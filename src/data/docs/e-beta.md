# Development Roadmap

If you get selected for testing, you will receive access to the following features, and be _directly involved_ in the development of our service:

1. <strong>Alpha Stage</strong>: Direct data collection + Heatmaps + Basic Dashboard + Basic Inputs + Basic Accounts
2. <strong>Beta Stage</strong>: Evolved Dashboard + Advanced data collection + Improved System + Other Inputs + Secure Accounts (per-account keys) + Payment + Launch
3. <strong>Gamma Stage</strong>: Suggestions + Better Interaction + Nieche Inputs + Improved Account System (per-website / domain / package keys)

Basically, the _alpha stage_ is invite-only, for testing purposes. The _beta stage_ will be finalized with the launch of the service, once everything is in order, and the _gamma stage_ will be the improvement part. Alpha is the prototype, beta is the base product, and then, world domination (just kidding).

If you get selected for thesting, you will automatically have access to the newest features starting from the stage you signed up for onwards. For example, if you signup _now_, you will receive access for everything, while signing up in the _beta stage_ will get you access to beta and gamma prototypes. 

Also, there are benefits for testing:

* You will be directly involved with developing the service, which means you can help make it better for you, and help get the features that _you_ want.
* At the launch, testers will be given discounts for the features they helped develop.
* The websites you helped us test with will be published in a _Hall of Fame_ on our website, and randomly shown on every page of our website.
* When the refferal system is implemented, you would be the first to reffer people (which means, you will be the first to make money for free).
