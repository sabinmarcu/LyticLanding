# Relationship with Google

We are not trying to compete with Google Analytics. The service we provide is in no way a complete replacement to Google's services, and nor should it. What we're offering you, is the parts that completes Google's services.

Google Analytics is really good at giving you information about your website in general, about your traffic, about demographics and a ton of more useful data. One thing lacking is an insight on the page itself, on a user's behaviour inside a web page. 

Google will help you discover a user's behaviour inside a website, from page to page, the pattern your visitors are usually following, but **why**? We can help you find out. We can help you discover why your users are going from one page to another, based on the first page itself.
