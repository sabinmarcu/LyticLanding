# Offer

What we are offering is something we love to call *Webpage Analytics*. Generally speaking, almost all of the existing analytics services concentrate on how a user, or a class of users are interacting with your website as a whole. They usually won't track what a user is doing inside a webpage. This is what we're offering: an in-depth analysis of a user's behaviour inside the page itself. We can tell you what they are interacting most, what they are using less, how much of your page is left unseen â€“ and **how** you can *improve* it.

Now, don't get us wrong, we're not competing with Google or any other website analytics company. What we are bringing you, is the pieces they are lacking. We are completing their service.

What we are offering you is a way to improve your designs and user interfaces, just as the other analytics companies are helping you improve your website structure and demographic targeting, SEO, etc.
