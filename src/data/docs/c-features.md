## The whole service is divided into two parts: 

* At first, we will help you colect the user`s information (movement, clicks, hovers, anything that can be considered interaction) from multiple inputs (mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, leap motion, etc)
* Afterwards we will analyse the data and present to you the output, either via a direct, visual representation of your collected data (via either graphs and charts on the dashboard, or directly on the page itself via heatmaps), or via suggestions, generated by our analysis system, or handled directly by a trained professional.

Both of these parts are crucial to a much better understanding of your visitor`s interaction with your webpages.

## Also, from the way we are doing things, we make sure that you can use our services on _responsive designs_, _web applications_, and anything that is not standard.
