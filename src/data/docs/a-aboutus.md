## *Lytic* is a start-up project at University of Southampton started in 2014, focusing on in-page statistical analysis of customer behaviours and provision of recommendations for higher performing websites.

Currently it is run by a team of 3 and they are now working on qualitative and quantitative analytic developments.

University of Southampton has been very keen to this project by giving mentor and financial support.
